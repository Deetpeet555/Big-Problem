    <h1>The Answer</h1>
    <h2>We obviously can't kill all pineapple pizza sympathizers or put them in "political reeducation" camps, but there may be something we can do. </h2>
    <h2>Maybe we can slowly tamper with pineapples bound for pizza resteraunts and make them taste gross and inedible. So that way, when people try pineapple pizza for the first time at a resteraunt, 
        they don't like it and never try it again.</h2>
    <h2>Stopping more sympathizers from joining the cause in the first place may be the only socially acceptable way of getting rid of pineapple pizza. 
        After their recruitment slows, the movement would slowly die out and be forgotten about.</h2>
