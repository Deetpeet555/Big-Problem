    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <h2>Good question. Pineapple is too sweet and it tastes out of place compared to other foods on the pizza. 
        It's kind of like having a big slice of tomato on a burger. It could be a great burger, but once you get to the tomato, that's all you can taste. 
        It's too powerful and overshadows the taste of the other ingredients.</h2>
    <h2>Pineapple is too powerful and sweet to be on pizza. When you bite into a slice of pineapple pizza, you get this out of place sweet taste in your mouth that throws you off and lowers the quality of the meal.</h2>
